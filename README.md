# Hi there, I’m **Sumit Kumar** 👋

I’m a software engineer and data-enthusiast with a passion for building robust systems, analyzing data, and creating tools that solve real-world problems.  
I currently work in the sales division of an IoT solutions provider, and I also enjoy exploring new technologies with open source.

## 🚀 What I do

- Develop and document **automated systems** in Python — for example, a _dynamic scent-distribution system_ for immersive experiences, a _customer-feedback analysis system_, and an _automated waste-sorting workflow_.  
- Create tools and modules in C++ and Python — I’m especially interested in inline functions, dealing with `isalpha()` and `getch()`, using range-based for loops, and designing Python modules with clear, well-commented code.  
- Work in data science & visualization — splitting datasets (e.g., 40 % test set, random state = 42), implementing K-nearest-neighbours by hand (k = 1), performing sentiment analysis on social media, and presenting insights to drive decisions.  
- Build applications & dashboards — I’ve used Flask + Dash for APIs and interactive visualisations aimed at IoT / industrial-machine modelling context.  
- Share and contribute to open-source code (check out my pinned repos below).

- **DataVisualizer** — Pre-process and transform your CSVs into smart, stunning charts in seconds.  
- **AdvancedLZW** — A compression platform implemented in C++.  
- **mDFSWeb** — A comprehensive distributed file-system with lock management implementation in Python.  
- **AiAgent** — An AI-powered sentiment-analysis platform built with HTML/Python.  
- **GEU_Connect** — An appointment-booking system (student–teacher) built for academic use.
